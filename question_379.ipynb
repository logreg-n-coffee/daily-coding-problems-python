    "The complexity of generating all possible subsequences of a string is inherently high because the number of possible subsequences of a string of length \\( n \\) is \\( 2^n \\), and we can't improve on that in terms of the number of subsequences generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are ways to improve on the implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **String Concatenation**: In the recursive approach, using string concatenation is expensive because strings in Python are immutable, which means every concatenation creates a new string. We can use a list to accumulate characters and then join them only when we need to add the subsequence to the result list. This reduces the cost of concatenation throughout the recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generator**: Instead of creating all subsequences at once and storing them in memory, you can use a generator to yield subsequences on-the-fly. This approach can be more memory efficient, especially when the subsequences are consumed one by one.\n",
