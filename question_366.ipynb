    "This problem was asked by Flexport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string s, rearrange the characters so that any two adjacent characters are not the same. If this is not possible, return null.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `s = yyz` then return `yzy`. If `s = yyy` then return null.\n"

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count the frequency of each character in the string.\n",
    "2. Sort the characters based on their frequencies in decreasing order.\n",
    "3. Create a new string where we place the most frequent characters first, while ensuring that no two adjacent characters are the same.\n",
    "4. If at any point, we can't place a character without violating the condition, return null.\n"
