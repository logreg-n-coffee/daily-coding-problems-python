    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number with all distinct digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the secret code. For example, if the secret code were 123456, then a guess of 175286 would score two, since 1 and 6 were correctly placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores, determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the following scores you should return True, since they correspond to the secret code 123456:\n",
    "\n",
    "{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is impossible for any key to result in the following scores, so in this case you should return False:\n",

    "## Step-by-step Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Mastermind Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastermind is a code-breaking game. One player (let's call them Player A) creates a secret code, and the other player (Player B) tries to guess it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code is a six-digit number.\n",
    "2. All the digits in the code are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring System:\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever Player B makes a guess, Player A responds with a score:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The score indicates how many digits in the guess are in the exact correct position when compared to the secret code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If the secret code is `123456`\n",
    "- And Player B guesses `175286`\n",
    "- Player A would respond with a score of 2 because digits `1` and `6` are in the correct positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a dictionary where:\n",
    "- The keys are guesses made by Player B.\n",
    "- The values are the scores given by Player A for those guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to determine if there exists a valid secret code that could have resulted in the provided guesses and scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the given scores are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}`\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is `True` because there is a valid secret code, which is `123456`, that satisfies these scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the guess `175286`, `1` and `6` are correctly placed (score 2).\n",
    "- For the guess `293416`, `2`, `3`, and `6` are correctly placed (score 3).\n",
    "- For the guess `654321`, no digits are correctly placed (score 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the given scores are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{123456: 4, 345678: 4, 567890: 4}`\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is `False` because there's no possible secret code that can satisfy all these scores at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write an algorithm (or function) that will take in the dictionary of scores and return `True` if a valid secret code exists that matches the scores or `False` otherwise."
