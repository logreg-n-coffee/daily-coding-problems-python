    "In order to construct the next-biggest integer, we should start by shifting the lowest 1-bit that has a 0-bit to the left. In other words, this would be the lowest 0-bit we can change in order to construct a larger number without adding more bits. Now that we've constructed a larger number, we need to minimize the remainder of the binary representation, keeping the number of set bits. To do this, we shift all remaining 1-bits to the right in order to make the remaining binary number as low as possible."
