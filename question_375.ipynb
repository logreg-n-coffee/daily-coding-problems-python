    "Given an array of natural numbers, with each value representing the number of citations of a researcher's paper, return the h-index of that researcher.\n",

    "[4, 0, 0, 2, 3]\n",

    "This means the researcher has 5 papers with 4, 1, 0, 2, and 3 citations respectively. The h-index for this researcher is 2, since they have 2 papers with at least 2 citations and the remaining 3 papers have no more than 2 citations.\n"
