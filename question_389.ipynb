    "Composition and inheritance are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) used to establish relationships between classes and objects. Understanding the difference between them and knowing when to use each is crucial for effective OOP design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Composition is a design principle where a class is made up of one or more objects of other classes. It's often described as a \"has-a\" relationship. For example, a `Car` class might have objects like `Engine`, `Wheel`, `Seat` as its members.\n",
    "- **Key Characteristic**: In composition, the lifecycle of the member objects is controlled by the parent object. When the parent object is destroyed, its composed objects are also destroyed.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Flexibility: You can easily replace the composed objects with different implementations.\n",
    "  - Maintainability: Changes in the composed objects have minimal impact on the parent class.\n",
    "  - Encapsulation: The internal details of composed objects can be hidden from the parent class.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**:\n",
    "  - When you want to use some aspects of an object without inheriting all of its properties and behaviors.\n",
    "  - When the relationship between objects is not naturally hierarchical.\n",
    "  - When you need to use multiple instances of a component within a container object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child or subclass) is created from an existing class (parent or superclass). It's characterized as an \"is-a\" relationship. For example, a `Bird` class might be inherited from an `Animal` class.\n",
    "- **Key Characteristic**: In inheritance, the child class inherits properties and methods from the parent class. It can also override or extend these methods.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Code Reusability: Shared behaviors of parent classes can be reused in child classes.\n",
    "  - Polymorphism: A child class can be treated as an instance of the parent class, which is useful for generalized programming.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**:\n",
    "  - When there's a clear hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "  - When multiple classes share common attributes and behaviors that can be abstracted into a parent class.\n",
    "  - When you need to implement polymorphic behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Between Composition and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Composition Over Inheritance Principle**: Favor composition over inheritance as a design choice. It provides more flexibility and avoids problems associated with deep and complex inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    "- **Use Inheritance Carefully**: Inheritance is powerful but can lead to a rigid structure if not used judiciously. It's best suited for situations where classes are in a natural hierarchy and share a significant amount of code.\n",
    "- **Decouple When Possible**: If two classes share functionality but don't have a natural hierarchical relationship, it's often better to use composition to keep them decoupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both composition and inheritance enable code reuse and organization, the choice between them depends on the nature of the relationship between the classes and the need for flexibility and maintainability in your design. Composition offers greater flexibility and easier maintenance, while inheritance is useful for hierarchical class relationships and polymorphism.\n"

    "Using code examples can be a great way to illustrate the concepts of composition and inheritance. Let's take a simple scenario and implement it using both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario: Vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are modeling different types of vehicles. We'll use a base class `Vehicle`, and then create specific types like `Car` and `Bicycle`. We'll also consider a component like `Engine`, which is part of some vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In an inheritance-based approach, `Car` and `Bicycle` would inherit from `Vehicle`. This means they are types of `Vehicle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Moving\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bicycle(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def pedal(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Pedaling\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "car = Car()\n",
    "car.move()        # Inherited from Vehicle\n",
    "car.start_engine()\n",
    "\n",
    "bicycle = Bicycle()\n",
    "bicycle.move()    # Inherited from Vehicle\n",
    "bicycle.pedal()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both `Car` and `Bicycle` inherit the `move` method from `Vehicle`, but they also have their specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Composition Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In a composition-based approach, we compose objects from other objects. Here, `Car` has an `Engine`, but `Vehicle` does not inherently have an `Engine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.engine = Engine()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        self.engine.start()\n",
    "        print(\"Car is moving\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bicycle:\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bicycle is moving\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "car = Car()\n",
    "car.move()  # Starts the engine and then moves\n",
    "\n",
    "bicycle = Bicycle()\n",
    "bicycle.move()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `Car` is composed of `Engine`, and it controls the lifecycle of the `Engine`. `Bicycle` doesn't have an `Engine`, demonstrating that composition allows for more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: `Car` and `Bicycle` are vehicles, so they inherit from `Vehicle`. They share common functionality but also extend with their specific behaviors.\n",
    "- **Composition**: `Car` has an `Engine`, represented by composition. This shows a \"has-a\" relationship and allows for more flexible object construction and lifecycle management.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how inheritance establishes a clear hierarchical relationship (is-a), while composition allows for flexible object composition based on behavior or capability (has-a).\n"
