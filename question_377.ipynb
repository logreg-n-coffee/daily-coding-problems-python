    "\n",
    "For **time complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion into heaps**: Insertion into a heap (either `lowers` or `highers`) is \\(O(\\log k)\\), where \\(k\\) is the window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removal from heaps**: We're using a lazy deletion approach. So, while the marking for deletion operation is \\(O(1)\\), the actual removal (via `heapq.heappop`) is \\(O(\\log k)\\). However, we need to consider that in the worst case, all elements in the window could be marked for deletion, so we might end up with a removal operation that is \\(O(k \\log k)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Balancing heaps**: The balancing steps (pushing an element from one heap to another) is \\(O(\\log k)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overall Loop**: We loop through the `arr` once, and for each of its \\(n\\) elements, we perform the operations mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, combining everything, the worst-case time complexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[O(n \\log k + n \\times k \\log k) = O(nk \\log k)\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The \\(nk \\log k\\) term dominates here due to the potential for the lazy deletion process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **space complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The two heaps together can have at most \\(k\\) elements, so that's \\(O(k)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The sliding window (`window`) also uses \\(O(k)\\) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `counts` dictionary can have at most \\(k\\) unique keys, with constant-sized values, so that's also \\(O(k)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these, the overall space complexity is \\(O(k)\\).\n"
