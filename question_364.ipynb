    "The problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of an array is a classic one. The \\(O(n^2)\\) dynamic programming solution is straightforward, but there's a more efficient \\(O(n \\log n)\\) algorithm that uses a combination of dynamic programming and binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the idea behind the \\(O(n \\log n)\\) algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty list called `tails`, where `tails[i]` will store the smallest tail element of all increasing subsequences of length \\(i + 1\\). Also, initialize the length of the LIS to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate through the input array**: For each number \\(x\\) in the array:\n",
    "   - If \\(x\\) is the smallest so far, start a new active list of length 1 with \\(x\\).\n",
    "   - If \\(x\\) is the largest so far, clone the longest active list and extend it by \\(x\\).\n",
    "   - If \\(x\\) is in between, find a list with the largest length such that it can be extended by \\(x\\). To do this efficiently, you can use binary search on the `tails` list.\n",
    "3. **Binary search**: Given a number \\(x\\) and the `tails` list, find the position \\(i\\) such that `tails[i - 1]` < \\(x\\) and `tails[i]` â‰¥ \\(x\\). Replace `tails[i]` with \\(x\\), because \\(x\\) is a better candidate to be the tail of subsequences of length \\(i + 1\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final length of the LIS will be the length of the `tails` list at the end of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step code implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary search function helps find the position at which the current number \\(x\\) should be placed in the `tails` list. The main function `longest_increasing_subsequence` computes the length of the LIS.\n"
