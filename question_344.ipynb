    "\n",
    "You are given a tree with an even number of nodes. Consider each connection between a parent and child node to be an \"edge\". You would like to remove some of these edges, such that the disconnected subtrees that remain each have an even number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose your input was the following tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "   1\n",
    "  / \\ \n",
    " 2   3\n",
    "    / \\ \n",
    "   4   5\n",
    " / | \\\n",
    "6  7  8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, removing the edge (3, 4) satisfies our requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that returns the maximum number of edges you can remove while still satisfying this requirement.\n"

    "## Solution \n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: \n",
    "* Each disconnected subtree should have an even number of nodes -> total number of nodes in each disconnected subtree must be even \n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: \n",
    "1. Start dfs from the root of the tree\n",
    "2. For each node encountered during dfs, compute the total number of nodes in the subtree rooted at that node\n",
    "3. If the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at a node is even, then we can remove the edge connecting this node to its parent, thereby creating a valid disconnected subtree"
